# Ether Piggy Bank

## 📝 Project Description
Ether Piggy Bank is a smart contract that acts as a digital savings account where users can lock their Ether until a specific unlock time. It enforces discipline by preventing early withdrawal and ensures safety by restricting access to only the contract owner.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a decentralized savings mechanism that promotes long-term holding habits and provides a secure, transparent, and verifiable way to manage time-locked assets on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 🔑 Key Features
- ✅ Time-locked Ether storage
- ✅ Owner-only access for withdrawal
- ✅ Safe and minimal contract logic
- ✅ Transparent balance visibility

## 🚀 Future Scope
- ⏳ Multiple savings goals (multi-lock functionality)
- 💵 Interest accumulation or staking integration
- 📱 Frontend DApp for interaction
- 🔐 Multi-user support with separate piggy banks
- 🔔 Notifications on unlock date using Chainlink alarms
